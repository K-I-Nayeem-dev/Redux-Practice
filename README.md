# Redux State Management

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of Redux for state management in a React application. Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

## Features
- **Global State Management:** Utilizes Redux to manage the application's global state.
- **Actions:** Defines action types and action creators to perform state changes.
- **Reducers:** Implements reducers to handle state transitions based on dispatched actions.
- **Store:** Sets up a Redux store to hold the application state.
- **Middleware:** Integrates middleware such as Redux Thunk for handling asynchronous actions.

## Technologies Used
- React
- Redux
- Redux Thunk
- JavaScript/ES6

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd redux-state-management`.

## Usage
1. Start the development server: `npm start` or `yarn start`.
2. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Explore the application and observe how Redux manages the state across components.
4. Experiment with different Redux features, actions, reducers, and middleware.
