# Redux State Management with API Fetch

## Overview
This project demonstrates the integration of Redux for state management in a React application, including fetching data from an API and managing it in the Redux store.

## Features
- **Global State Management:** Utilizes Redux to manage the application's global state.
- **Actions:** Defines action types and action creators to perform state changes, including API data fetching actions.
- **Reducers:** Implements reducers to handle state transitions based on dispatched actions.
- **Store:** Sets up a Redux store to hold the application state.
- **Middleware:** Integrates middleware such as Redux Thunk for handling asynchronous actions, including API data fetching.

## Technologies Used
- React
- Redux
- Redux Thunk
- JavaScript/ES6
